# Magic Cube Boxes

In this repository you'll find a collection of high-quality scans of the boxes for all 20 known variants of the Magic Cube produced by Politechnika (later Politoys) from 1977 to 1982. More info available [here](http://twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=411019#p411019). The Magic Cube was the precursor to the Rubik's Cubeâ„¢, and was manufactured in Budapest, Hungary for some time before its introduction to the U.S. market. It took me 5 years to collect at least one of each variant.
